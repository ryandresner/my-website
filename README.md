"More pictures would be nice also!"
    
    -Added js picture slideslow to homepage to make it more interesting.



"The first thing I would work on is contrast in some places. I think you do a good job in most spots, using lighter text on darker backgrounds. The one issue I spotted was with the nav bar. I did not notice the navbar for a little while due to the low contrast with the dark buttons and the dark background of the nav bar itself. This could be easier to spot for some than me but it was something I noticed."

"This is probably personal preference, but it might look nice if the nav bar extended the length of the screen to make it pop more, or you could add some color to the empty half of the bar at the top, maybe another gradient?"

    - Changed outline colors to white and increased text size to make it stand out more. Thank you for the feedback!



"The footer seems to float up rather high on the pages, especially on the game page. It could be there's some unintended padding or margins being applied. "

"The next thing I would look at would be the footer on your games page. It is quite high up on the page. This can look a little awkward. To fix this, you can utilize CSS flexboxes to keep the footer at the bottom of the page, regardless of screen height."

    -I agree. Adjusted margins to make the footer feel more like a "footer". Did not implement flexbox at this time as I am not sold on how I have designed the current footer. Most likely will scrap it. 


"I noticed a breakpoint with the nav bar and banner at around 590px, they sit offset and it looks a little awkward. You could try setting them side by side or extending the nav elements for it to look more centered when stacked."

    -Adjusted minsize of banner image so that it does not allow for the game at 590px.
